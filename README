Algorithm-BaumWelch version 0.0.2

The Baum-Welch algorithm is used to compute the parameters (transition and emission probabilities) of an HMM. The
algorithm calculates the forward and backwards probabilities for each HMM state and then re-estimates the parameters of
the model. 

This module has been tested with a number of 2-hidden state cases but as yet has been subject to almost no testing with >2 hidden states.
